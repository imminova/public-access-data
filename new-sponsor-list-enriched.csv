Our mission is to make this a reality by giving everyone access to their Personal Health Record (PHR), enabling them to control who sees it, understand what it means, and become a partner in managing their health.
Our single patient record is the foundation. It seamlessly integrates data from diverse sources—healthcare providers, devices, and patient contributions—and delivers the data wherever the patient needs it—through robust read-write APIs and with dedicated interfaces for patients and professionals. 
All of this is governed by the patient. Our intuitive patient interface provides comprehensive access to appointments, documents, test results, and care plans, alongside crucial consent and secure sharing management.
As one of the UK's first B Corporations (certified 2015), social and environmental responsibility is central to our identity. Our platform fosters sustainable healthcare by shifting from reactive treatment to proactive, preventative care. Informed patients manage conditions better, leading to improved long-term health and efficient resource use. Our digital-first approach also reduces healthcare's environmental footprint through less travel and paper.
In the UK, PKB serves over 5 million registered patients, delivering 20+ million test results monthly. We completed national integration with all Dutch providers in 2022 and GP data integration for all adults in England in Spring 2025.   Our seamless integration with the NHS App provides a single front door for NHS patients, registering 100,000 patients a month.  From our established presence across the UK and EU to our recent expansion into Africa, our vision remains the same: to ensure every person has the power to improve their health through control of their data.","Transforming Healthcare with a Single Patient Record | The World's Largest Personal Health Platform
